<p>Hey, this is Eric.</p>

<p>A freshman of front-end developing.</p>

<p>In the next days, I will do everything that I can to enrich my life and to see how beautiful the world can be. And absolutely, it wiil be. Cause I am a developer and pre-engineer now, that is what I will do and I will record it here. That is what my blog serves.</p>

<p>Can't wait to do it now. Let's go!</p>
